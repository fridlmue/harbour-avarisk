## pyAvaCore - download and parse [EAWS](https://www.avalanches.org/) avalanche bulletins
The Python core of avaRisk - pyAvaCore - moved to an external repository at https://gitlab.com/albina-euregio/pyAvaCore. PyAvaCore is used to download and parse the avalanche bulletins from the different warning services in a common object. From Version 0.8 the Python-Code will be used from this project. Core component development and adding new Regions will be tracked there.

## Download and Install
- avaRisk can be found and installed from openrepos. (https://openrepos.net/content/fridl/avarisk-avalanche-bulletins)
- avaRisk can be found and installed from the Jolla Store/Sailfish Harbour. (https://harbour.jolla.com/)

### Regions, that can't be implemented at the moment

- Finnland: answered on 2020-12-22 not to have an open api. Publication is here: https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/avalanche-forecast. Open Datasets of this provider can be found here: https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data-sets-available.

### Additional Regions:
For other Regions (in Europe) I need local help to figure out if the local Avalanche Warning Service releases an XML in the CAAML-Format (http://caaml.org/Schemas/V5.0/Profiles/BulletinEAWS/). Then I need the Link to the XML (if available also for different Languages) and the names of all the "micro regions" that are served in that bulletin/XML. This is normally an ID and a Name (e.g. from TYROL: "AT-07-08" - "Zentrale Lechtaler Alpen", can be found here: https://lawinen.report/education/handbook).

## Translation

For Tyrol, South Tirol, Trentino and Val d'Aran the Bulletins are available in much more language versions (ES, FR, IT, CA and OC). But I'm not able to translate the App to these Languages. So if someone can translate the Translation-Strings it is possible to make full localized versions of those languages for the named regions. The region names for the sub regions also could be translated. The names can be found here: https://avalanche.report/education/handbook and for Val d'Aran here: https://gitlab.com/albina-euregio/albina-admin-gui/-/blob/master/src/app/regions/regions.aran.geojson.json. If someone want to help with a translation please create an Issue. I'm happy to support for any kind of questions. 

Translation is done on Transifex: https://www.transifex.com/avarisk/harbour-avarisk
Englisch is 'Englisch_US', Source language is set to 'Englisch' but in fact has the local names of all the regions.

Assets have been taken from https://avalanche.report / https://gitlab.com/albina-euregio/albina-website. It is great, that they started with providing high quality Avalanche Risk Assessments in a common open format in the international ALBINA project.
Many thanks to the "CROSSRISK" project partners (in particular ZAMG https://www.zamg.ac.at/) for providing unifyed data at https://www.avalanche-warnings.eu/. 
Big thanks to all the Avalanche Warning Services who provide the data open and for the great work they do and EAWS (https://www.avalanches.org/) for the standardization efforts.
